<WordList :line="true">
Vue is a JavaScript framework that helps developers build user interfaces efficiently using a declarative and component-based programming model. It extends standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provides features such as declarative rendering and reactivity to track JavaScript state changes and update the DOM efficiently.

Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable, and can be used in different ways depending on the use case, such as enhancing static HTML or building single-page applications. Vue also supports Single-File Components for authoring Vue components, which we can write the component's logic, template, and styles in a single file. Vue components can be authored in two different API styles, Options API and Composition API, both of which are capable of covering common use cases. The Options API is more beginner-friendly, while the Composition API enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.

先做自我介绍w

Hey, I am Sheng Xinjing, a self-employed programmer whose main job is to build programming courses and contribute to the open-source project 

With 10 years of javascript development experience and 5 years of management,  I am very happy to join this group to improve my English skills and I am planning to find a remote job abroad in the future.

Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling, reading, and computer games, If you happen to be in the same city I live ( currently in Beijing ), maybe we can hang out and code together.
